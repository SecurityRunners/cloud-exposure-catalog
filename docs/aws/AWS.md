## Resource Based Policies

Resource-based policies are attached to a resource. With resource-based policies, you can specify who has access to the resource and what actions they can perform on it. This list is from [AWS services that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html#swwiam_footnotes_vpc) but includes some resources that cannot be publicly exposed but do support resource based policies.
